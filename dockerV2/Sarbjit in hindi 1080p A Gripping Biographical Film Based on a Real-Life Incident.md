## Sarbjit Movie Review: A Heartbreaking Tale of Injustice and Courage
 
Sarbjit is a movie that will make you cry, rage and admire the resilience of the human spirit. It is based on the true story of Sarabjit Singh, an Indian farmer who was arrested by Pakistan in 1990 and accused of being a spy and a terrorist. He spent 22 years in a Pakistani prison, facing torture and humiliation, while his sister Dalbir Kaur fought tirelessly for his release.
 
The movie is directed by Omung Kumar, who previously made Mary Kom, another biopic of a brave Indian. The movie boasts of powerful performances by Randeep Hooda as Sarbjit, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan as Dalbir and Richa Chadha as Sukhpreet, Sarbjit's wife. The movie also features Darshan Kumaar as Awais Sheikh, a Pakistani lawyer who helps Dalbir in her quest.
 
The movie does not shy away from showing the harsh realities of Sarbjit's ordeal. The scenes of his imprisonment are disturbing and graphic, but also realistic and effective. The movie also portrays the complex political and social dynamics between India and Pakistan, and how they affect the lives of ordinary people on both sides of the border.
 
The movie also highlights the emotional journey of Dalbir, who sacrifices her own happiness and family for her brother's sake. She faces many obstacles and challenges, but never gives up hope. Aishwarya Rai Bachchan delivers a convincing and nuanced performance as Dalbir, showing her strength, vulnerability and determination.
 
Randeep Hooda is outstanding as Sarbjit, transforming himself physically and mentally for the role. He makes us feel his pain, his fear and his love for his family. He also shows us glimpses of Sarbjit's innocence and optimism, despite his tragic fate.
